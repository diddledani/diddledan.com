After a brief foray into the world of joomla!, I have decided that I like WordPress much better for bloggy-type stuffs, and possibly for other less bloggy-type situations. Comments are included in WordPress as standard, whereas I needed to add them to joomla!. Joomla defaulted to a weird layout that I couldn't work out how to change, which meant that there were multiple columns of entries on the blog page, which needn't necessarily be in the right order â€“ especially if you read left-to-right rather than top-to-bottom.

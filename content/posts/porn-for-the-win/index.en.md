It would appear that news has surfaced about the interior ministry of Great Britain, aka the Home Office. The news article I read states that [The Home Office](https://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/) website was linking to a Japanese pornography site. Since being alerted in a round about way by a BBC viewer via the Broadcaster, the Home Office has removed the offending link.

> It was a link from the Home Office website to the Technical Advisory Board, which is an external website. It is their website that was hacked and re-directed to a porn site.
> 
> We were alerted today, we took immediate action, we removed the link and we are now investigating.
> 
> <cite>Home Office via AFP</cite>

It appears that the original link was correct, but the site had since become "defunct" and sold onto another company.

What's worse, however, is 'Home Secretary' Jacqui Smith's recent expense claim. This was filed on her behalf, rather than by herself, and included two pay-per-view pornographic movies. It was said that the movies were watched by Jacqui's husband, but didn't mention whether Jacqui saw them also.

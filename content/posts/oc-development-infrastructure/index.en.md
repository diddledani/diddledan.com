In the linked post, I discuss the infrastructure that I've put in place to aid the development of the Occasionwise facebook application. The infrastructure can also be turned to *any* web development needs. It keeps multiple developers happy with version control while also maintaining a live website for them to check their changes as they're made.

Please check out both Occasionwise and our Facebook Application at the following urls:

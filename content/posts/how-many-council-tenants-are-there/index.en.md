My council tax statement arrived this morning and with it was a little booklet which explains their figures. While leafing through this booklet one thing stood out:

> We get funding from:
> 
> Housing benefit grant from the Government â€“ 46%
> 
> <cite>Basingstoke and Deane Council Tax Breakdown Booklet</cite>

What this suggests to me, is that the same percentage (46) of homes in the "borough" are in fact paid for by housing benefit, which would account for the large sum of income coming from the government via council tax benefit (which is bundled-in with the housing benefit). This suggests that nearly half of the borough's residents are on low wage jobs or have no jobs at all making them eligible for the housing/council tax benefit.

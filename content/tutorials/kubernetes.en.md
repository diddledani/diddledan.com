## Motivation

Regular Twitch streamer, [Jeff Fritz (csharpfritz)](https://twitch.tv/csharpfritz) has been trying to configure a Kubernetes cluster using [K3s by Rancher Labs](https://k3s.io/) installation on six Raspberry Pis. They hit multiple roadblocks, such as trying to set up NFS-based Persistent Volumes in the cluster shared between the nodes, and accessing the dashboard. I took their frustration as a prompt to write up some tutorials that explain everything you need and why.

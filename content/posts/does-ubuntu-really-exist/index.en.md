... well not according to microsoft, it would seem.

[https://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=ubuntu+imac+24inch+2007&amp;form=QBRE](https://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=ubuntu+imac+24inch+2007&form=QBRE) vs [https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=imac+24inch+2007+ubuntu](https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=imac+24inch+2007+ubuntu)

So the question raises itself, are microsoft actively removing the ubuntu forums from their search results?

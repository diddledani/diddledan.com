So I finally got around to uploading a copy of ThemeDeFrem WordPress theme for the world at large to play with. The source is all available at the github (<https://github.com/lucyllewy/ThemeDeFrem>). Fork away and enjoy. I will be adding customisable colour schemes and whatnot, too, in the future. Also on the cards is native support for google ads and the [wibiya](https://web.archive.org/web/20171109001528/http://www.wibiya.com/) sitebar (both of which I had here on my own site until I uploaded the latest copy of the theme).

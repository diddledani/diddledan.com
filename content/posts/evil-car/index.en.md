I got [this link](https://www.autoblog.com/2007/05/04/top-gear-crowns-weber-supercar-ugliest-car-of-2007) off threenine in IrCQNet's #computers channel. When I saw the car, I almost vomited. Yes, it truly is that vile. I still can't look at the image, even knowing what it contains, without feeling queasy and needing to turn away. This car really is the epitome of bad design. As someone is quoted as saying: "All those mangled panels are apparently essential in gaining greater aerodynamic efficiency, presumably because the Weber's appearance physically scares the air out of its path."

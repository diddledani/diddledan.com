I've now reimplemented an older theme that I had archived. I feel that these dark nights require a dark theme. (Though the nights aren't dark for those in the southern hemisphere, more's the pity. I'm looking at you, Deadpan110! :-p) Plus, this theme has the nice snowy bottom, though I think it needs a bit of a tweak. I really should package up "ThemeDeFrem" and release the code, but that would mean stripping out the adsense, and that takes effort, which I'm just too lazy to put in.
